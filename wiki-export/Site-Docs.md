# Site Documentation Guidelines

(Imported from `site-docs.md`)

Documentation must be kept up to date. Maintain a `README.md`, `change.md` and an `issues-log.md`. Include dedicated docs for major features and integrations (Directus, Cloudflare, analytics, forms). See the full repository for implementation details.
