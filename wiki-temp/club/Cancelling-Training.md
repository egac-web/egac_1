# Cancelling Training

To ensure there is a consistent approach to cancelling training.

**Process:**

1. A decision to cancel at least 90 minutes prior to the training session on the day of training.
2. Announcements must be made immediately in the Clubs WhatsApp community.
3. If possible, a notification via the [England Athletics portal](https://myathletics.englandathletics.org/portal/Members/Login) via email to all members should be sent.
4. Coaches must also check if there are any athletes due for taster sessions and they must be contacted directly as they will not receive WhatsApp Community announcements.
